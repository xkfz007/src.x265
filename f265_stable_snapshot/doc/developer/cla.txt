1. The term "contribution" means any source code, object code, patch, tool,

you and otherwise ever included in the project as of the date you agree to
these terms.


2. With respect to any worldwide copyrights, or copyright applications and
registrations, in any contribution:

- you hereby assign to us joint ownership, and to the extent that such
  assignment is or becomes invalid, ineffective or unenforceable, you hereby
  grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge,
  royalty-free, unrestricted license to exercise all rights under those
  copyrights. This includes, at our option, the right to sublicense these same
  rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other
  arrangements;

- you agree that we can do all things in relation to any contribution as if we
  were the sole owners, and if we make a derivative work of any contribution,
  we will be the sole owner of that derivative work;

  against us, our licensees or transferees;

- you agree that we may register a copyright in any contribution and exercise
  all ownership rights associated with it; and

- you agree that we have no duty to consult with, obtain the consent of, pay or
  render an accounting to you for any use or distribution of any contribution.


3. With respect to any patents in a contribution that you own, or that you can
license without payment to any third party, you hereby grant to us a perpetual,
irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to:

- make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, transfer and otherwise
  practice any contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with
  or included in the project or any product, work, or materials arising out of
  the project; and

  multiple levels of sublicensees or other arrangements.


4. Except as set out above, as between you and us, you keep all right, title,
and interest in any contribution. The rights that you grant to us under these
terms are effective on the date the contribution was first submitted to us,
even if the submission took place before the date you agree to these terms. We
will use commercially reasonable efforts to make any contribution we make
available under any license also available under a license compatible with the
BSD 2-Clause License.


5. With respect to any contribution, you represent that:

- it is an original work and that you can legally grant the rights set out in
  these terms;

- it does not to the best of your knowledge violate any third party's
  copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other non-patent intellectual
  property rights; and

- you are authorized to sign this contract on behalf of your company (if
  identified below).
