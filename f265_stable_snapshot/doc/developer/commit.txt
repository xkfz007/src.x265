This document describes the commit guidelines.


* Committing on Git.

We use Git for source control. The "master" branch has the latest stable
release. The "develop" branch has the bleeding edge code. Changes go in
the develop branch first.

Do not merge branches. Instead, rebase your topic branch on top of the develop
branch. It doesn't matter whether you create several small commits or one large
commit. However, remove junk commits and describe all the changes in the commit
message. We want a clean linear history.

Make sure the regression suite passes prior to pushing your changes.
